# Documentation Overview

Start here for a high-level map of Luxelithâ€™s voxel engine and links to per-script references.

- Streaming and meshing pipeline
  - WorldStreamer orchestrates chunk lifecycle and rendering
  - GpuMesher builds meshes on the GPU via greedy compute kernels
  - Chunk and ChunkDefs define data layout, limits, and helpers
  - TerrainGeneration schedules a Burst IJob (FBM sample) to fill voxel data
- Blocks and textures
  - BlockDefinition and BlockDefinitionDatabase define blocks and per-face texture indices
  - BlockDatabaseIntegration uploads per-face indices to the mesher
  - BlockDatabase and BlockTypes provide runtime ids and legacy UV triplets
- Tooling and utilities
  - BlockEditor editor window for per-face textures with live preview
  - TextureArrayShaderGUI material inspector for texture array shaders
  - VoxelEngineSetupValidator validates scene setup and can auto-wire required refs
  - BuildDiagnostic runtime overlay for performance/support checks
  - PlayerFlyController free-fly controller for testing
